# docs/user-uploaded

This folder stores files uploaded by the repository owner (not generated by agents or automation). It serves two purposes:

## 1. Schema Iteration History

Creating working ChatGPT agent schemas often requires iterating with a non-repo-bridge-connected AI (plain ChatGPT, not the GPT agent) to debug idiosyncratic OpenAPI/tool-schema issues that aren't covered in official docs. Snapshots of schemas are saved here at key change points so there's a record of what was working before a change was made.

**Naming conventions:**
- `lkw-` prefix = "Last Known Working" — a backup of the schema that was operational before a replacement was deployed. The date in the filename is when it was *archived*, not necessarily when it was created.
- `chatgpt-tool-schema-vX.Y.Z.json` = a schema snapshot tagged to a specific version.

## 2. Reference Uploads

The owner occasionally uploads copies of docs from other repos (agent-boot README, taxonomy, etc.) for reference during schema/instructions development. These are snapshots, not canonical — the source repos are authoritative.

## Subfolder Structure

Each dated subfolder (e.g., `2026-02-05/`, `2026-02-07/`) groups uploads by the date they were placed here. Files in these folders may become superseded as the project evolves. See the folder's own contents for what's current vs. archived.

## Current State (as of 2026-02-07)

- `2026-02-05/chatgpt-tool-schema-v1.2.1.json` — Archived. Superseded by `docs/chatgpt-tool-schema.json` (v1.5.0).
- `2026-02-07/lkw-chatgpt-agent-schema-2026-02-07.json` — Archived. Last known working schema (v1.4.0) before the v1.5.0 update that removed dryRun.

Files that were previously in `2026-02-07/` (AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md, MULTI_REPO_GUIDE, README, TAXONOMY.md) have been removed — their content is superseded by the canonical files in `docs/` and the root `AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
